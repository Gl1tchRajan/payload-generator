**Payload Generator**
Payload Generator is a C-based command-line tool developed to improve my understanding of system programming, memory management, file handling, and cryptographic implementations.
This project focuses on practical development experience, implementing payload generation and encryption techniques manually to better understand how low-level systems and security tools operate.

**Features**
1. Generate random text and binary payloads
2. XOR-based encryption implementation
3. ChaCha20 encryption support
4. Output payload in hexadecimal format
5. Automatic file generation and saving
6. Logging functionality for tracking operations
7. Modular project structure with multiple source and header files
8. Build automation using Makefile

**Technologies Used**
1. C Programming Language
2. File I/O Handling
3. Dynamic Memory Management
4. Basic Cryptography Implementation
5. Command-Line Interface Development
6. Makefile Build System

**Installation**
Clone the Repository
**git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Payload-Generator.git**
cd Payload-Generator
Build the Project
make

**Usage**
Run the tool using:
./payload

**What I Learned**
Building this project improved my skills in:
1. Structuring medium-sized C projects
2. Writing modular and maintainable code
3. Managing memory efficiently
4. Handling file operations securely
5. Implementing basic encryption algorithms
6. Understanding how payload generation works internally
7. Automating compilation with Makefile
8. This project helped me connect theoretical cybersecurity knowledge with real-world implementation.
