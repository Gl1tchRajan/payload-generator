**Payload Generator:**

Payload Generator is a C-based command-line application designed to explore low-level system programming concepts including memory management, file handling, modular architecture, and cryptographic implementation.
This project focuses on manually implementing encryption techniques and payload generation logic to gain deeper insight into how security tools and system-level utilities function internally.

**Features:**
1. Generate random text and binary payloads
2. XOR-based encryption implementation
3. ChaCha20 encryption support
4. Output payload in hexadecimal format
5. Automatic file generation and saving
6. Logging functionality for tracking operations
7. Modular project structure with multiple source and header files
8. Build automation using Makefile

**Technologies Used:**
1. C Programming Language
2. File I/O Handling
3. Dynamic Memory Management
4. Basic Cryptography Implementation
5. Command-Line Interface Development
6. Makefile Build System

**Installation:**
Clone the Repository
**git clone https://github.com/Gl1tchRajan/Payload-Generator.git**
, cd Payload-Generator
, Build the Project
, make.

**Usage:**
Run the tool using:
./payload
